# Human_Body_Detection_using_OpenCV_and_Mediapipe


Behind the scenes, Mediapipe Holistic, the model shown in this video, uses deep learning models to be able to accurately detect keypoints.
Using this model you can begin to prototype a whole bunch of different use cases like touchless gesture control, human sentiment analysis and could even build your own exercise counter!
